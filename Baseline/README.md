# Baseline Displays

For the baseline displays, we have multiple different ways to visualize the patient's data within the following M's: "What Matters", "Mobility", and "Mentation". 

## M focused Overview
This overview visualization attempts to draw attention to the 'M' and not the individual metrics within the 'M'. Then, if the partipant wants to further engage with a particular 'M', we can dive into it with other visualizations.

Here is an example of what the M focused overview might look like:

## Fully Labeled Overview
This overview is fully labeled and allows the participant to see exactly what is going on in one visualization. 

Here is what it might look like with the same data as above:
